# OCI Image: Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (Noble Numbat), Integration Test Target (ITT)

[Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (Noble Numbat)](https://releases.ubuntu.com/noble/) (Linux) for integration testing.

Main features of the [OCI](https://opencontainers.org/) image:

* Fully functional [`systemd`](https://systemd.io/) (not a shim)
* Unprivileged execution support

The image aims to replicate a "VM-like" operating system environment while maintaining container portability, making it ideal for:

* DevOps validation (like testing Ansible collections, roles, and playbooks)
* CI pipeline testing for quick smoke tests (e.g. before running full VM integration test)
* Development environments requiring systemd
* Testing system services and daemons

## How to build<a id="build"></a>

The sources are available at the [`foundata/oci-ubuntu2404-itt` repository](https://github.com/foundata/oci-ubuntu2404-itt). To build the image locally, do the following:

1. [Install Podman](https://podman.io/docs/installation).
2. Clone or pull the latest changes from this Git repository.
3. Change into the directory and execute the [build command](https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-build.1.html):
   ```bash
   podman build -t ubuntu2404-itt .
   ```



## How to use<a id="usage"></a>

1. [Install Podman](https://podman.io/docs/installation).
2. Use the image you built earlier or pull the image from a registry:
   - [Quay](https://quay.io/repository/foundata/ubuntu2404-itt):
     ```bash
     podman pull quay.io/foundata/ubuntu2404-itt:latest
     ```
   - [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/foundata/ubuntu2404-itt):
     ```bash
     podman pull docker.io/foundata/ubuntu2404-itt:latest
     ```
3. Run a container from the image:
   ```bash
   podman run --detach --systemd=always ubuntu2404-itt:latest "/lib/systemd/systemd"
   ```
   Note: **On SELinux-enabled systems**, systemd attempts to write to the cgroup filesystem, which is typically denied by default security policies. To allow this operation, you must **enable the `container_manage_cgroup` boolean** on the host system: `sudo setsebool -P container_manage_cgroup 1`
4. You can now work with the container, e.g. open a Bash terminal:
   ```bash
   podman ps
   podman exec -it "<container-id-or-name>" "/bin/bash"
   ```
   Look around and check if `systemd` is really working:
   ```bash
   cat /etc/os-release
   systemctl status
   ```



## Notes<a id="notes"></a>

This image is built and tested with [Podman](https://podman.io/) only.

We currently do *not* support [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (but it might work with `sudo` and `--privileged --volume=/sys/fs/cgroup/systemd:/sys/fs/cgroup/systemd:rw --cgroupns=host --env container=docker` instead of `--systemd=always`).

> **Important**: This image is not hardened or optimized for production use. It prioritizes compatibility and functionality over security and performance and is for usage in isolated environments only.
